\section{Introduction}

News, TV, market analysis, Movies or Video on demand, etc were part of content distribution by specific organization / Production house to sell it to broadcaster to further use the content. All these distribution was one way communication and hardly possible to get exact Television Rating point (TRP) or feedback about article. Internet has given us flexibility to get feedback on the good / bad videos, Photos to reach 50million user Radio took 38 years, TV almost 13 years, Internet just 3years and facebook added 200 million user in less than a year. 
Such a heavy internet usage has raised a concern over data (content) availability and analysis to make it effective for marketing and strategic business as most of the data available is unstructured form.
